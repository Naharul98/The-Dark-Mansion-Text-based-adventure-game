Each item has their own respective weight units. The player has a maximum unit of weight (100 units) that he can carry in his backpack. The player can also check his inventory contents at any time during the game, in addition, he can also drop item from his inventory in any room he wants, and he can also pick it up again from the room in which he dropped the item in the first place.

The game features 9 major intuitive commands, that can be used by the player to interact with the game/game environment, in order to explore, solve puzzles and finally escape the mansion!
